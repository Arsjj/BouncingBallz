# Bouncing Ballz

## Description

Micro physics simulator in browser

### Usage

**Interacting with the Canvas:**
   - Click on the canvas to add a new ball at the click position with random properties.
   - Use the control sliders to adjust `dx` (horizontal velocity), `dy` (vertical velocity), `gravity`, `elasticity`, and `friction` of the balls.

### Control Elements

- **Left/Right (`dx`):** Adjusts the horizontal velocity of the balls.
- **Top/Bottom (`dy`):** Adjusts the vertical velocity of the balls.
- **Gravity:** Modifies the gravitational force affecting the balls.
- **Elasticity:** Changes the bounce coefficient of the balls.
- **Friction:** Alters the friction applied to the balls when they bounce.
